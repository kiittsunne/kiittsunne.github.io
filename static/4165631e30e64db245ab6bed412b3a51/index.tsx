          <p>
            I graduated from the National University of Singapore (Political
            Science major, Public Health minor) in 2020 â€“ directly into my
            country's COVID-19 lockdown.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having always had a deep love for tech and things to tinker with, I
            embarked on a whirlwind non-linear 2-year journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got to observe the boardrooms of the policy world as a public
            servant (MCI), and braved the 24/7 battleground of tech/business
            operations (Shopee).
          </p>
          <p>
            In each of these roles, I relished the challenge of learning to read
            and navigate complex systems - both technical and organisational.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Working shoulder to shoulder with developers every day at Shopee
            allowed me a window into the world of software engineering. Their
            encouragement gave me confidence to enrol in General Assembly's
            full-time Software Engineering Intensive, and finally pivot towards
            a career in engineering
