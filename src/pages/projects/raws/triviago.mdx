# TRIVIAGO

### Project Overview

My friends and I enjoy puzzle hunts and knowing lots of random trivia is usually helpful. This made me think of creating Triviago partly as a training tool, partly as a fun side project, and partly as a way to explore newer frontend technologies.

In the end, the game has 3 'game modes':
