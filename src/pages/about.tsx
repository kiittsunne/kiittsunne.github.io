        <p>
          I graduated from the National University of Singapore (Political
          Science major, Public Health minor) in 2020 â€“ directly into my
          country's COVID-19 lockdown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having always had a deep love for tech and things to tinker with, I
          embarked on a whirlwind non-linear 2-year journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got to observe the boardrooms of the policy world as a public
          servant (MCI), and braved the 24/7 battleground of tech/business
          operations (Shopee).
        </p>
        <p>
          In each of these roles, I relished the challenge of learning to read
          and navigate complex systems - both technical and organisational.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Working shoulder to shoulder with developers every day at Shopee
          allowed me a window into the world of software engineering. Their
          encouragement gave me confidence to enrol in General Assembly's
          full-time Software Engineering Intensive, and finally pivot towards a
          career in engineering
